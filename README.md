Controlling an RGB LED light strip over the network via a Raspberry Pi


Features
--------

* Should work with common-anode RGB LED strips
* Web form for setting colors (color picker imported from [taufik-nurrohman/color-picker](https://github.com/taufik-nurrohman/color-picker), falls back to HTML5 color picker if no JavaScript)
* HTTP JSON API for setting colors, predefined patterns, or custom timed patterns
* UDP OSC API for setting colors or predefined patterns (tested with [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net))


Hardware
--------

### Parts Used

* 3x [N-channel MOSFETs](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10213)
* 3x 15 Î© resistors (other small resistors would work; probably not required)
* 1x [ATX Power Connector Breakout Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15701)
* 1x [Raspberry Pi](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/395) (tested with RPi 4B but other models should work)

Software
--------

A nightly Rust toolchain is required so using [rustup](https://rustup.rs) is recommended. Running `cargo run --release` will run the daemon, which includes a light pattern animation and output thread, HTTP server, and OSC server. In a deployment, the `static` and `templates` directories as well as the binary are the only artifacts needed.
